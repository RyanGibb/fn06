Kind: _Curried Pumpkin_

Roll: _Petite Baguette_

Description: _Back to back curried soups, however this one was more tangy (likened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_yum">Tom Yum</a>) and perfect for Autumn. Really great and full of flavour!_

Kind: _Curried Parsnip_

Roll(s): _Poppy Seed and Linseed_

Description: _Full bodied and a hint of spice. For some the spice was "too much to eat quickly". That same person preferred the Broccoli soup, though their opinion was in the minority._

Kind: _Broccoli and Thai Green Curry_
