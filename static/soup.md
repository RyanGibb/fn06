        <p>Description: <em>Back to back curried soups, however this one was more tangy (likened to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_yum">Tom Yum</a>) and perfect for Autumn. Really great and full of flavour!</em></p>

        <p>Description: <em>Full bodied and a hint of spice. For some the spice was "too much to eat quickly". That same person preferred the Broccoli soup, though their opinion was in the minority.</em></p>
